        <h2>What do we do?</h2>
        <p>HotBeans Web is a web development firm which specialises in commission-based coding for our clients. We employ a small amount of dedicated, talented coders to make thrilling websites for fair prices.</p>
        <p>The point which makes us stand out from our competitors is that we do not hire based on experience alone. HotBeans Web is more than happy to take on highly talented coders who may have been turned away from other companies due to being new to the industry.</p>
        <p>For more information about how we run our company and how we came to be, look at <a href="about.html">our About Us page.</a></p>
        <p>If you would like to know who we are currently taking aboard as trainees, please look at <a href="about.html">our Trainees page.</a></p>
